# Conventions

### Naming
* Functions in render functions which return a component needs to have its name start with render. Eg. A function which returns a block with a Clock, text and a Button will have the name renderClock or similar.
* When adding an event listener, the naming of the function should be 'on' and the event name follows as defined in the DOM functions
